# Credit Key Magento 2 Module

## Installation

From your root Magento directory, run the following command:

```
% composer require creditkey/b2bgateway
% composer require creditkey/creditkey-php
```
Download and copy folder lib from https://github.com/creditkey/magento2.1-b2bgateway/tree/master/lib to folder lib at root Magento directory 

Then enable the module with the following commands:
```
% php bin/magento module:enable CreditKey_B2BGateway
% php bin/magento setup:upgrade && php bin/magento setup:di:compile && php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```

## Configuration

From the Magento admin, navigate to ```Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods``` and scroll down to the ```Credit Key (Gateway)``` section.

The `Marketing Content on Product Pages` section allows you to enable the Credit Key marketing content to be displayed on the selected product detail pages. You can enable/disable this feature globally, select the specific categories to allow the content to be displayed on the products belonging to said categories, and select the style of the displayed content.

## Customization

To move the location of the marketing display on the product details page you will need to modify the file `catalog_product_view.xml` from your active theme. This will most likely be located at `{magento_root}/app/design/frontend/{YourCompany}/{theme-name}/Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_product_view.xml`. 

In this file you would simply use the `<move>` element to move our block, named `product.info.creditkey.marketing`, to the new location. For example, if you wanted it to be just below the "Add to Cart" button it would look something like the following where `element` is the name of our block, `destination` is the name of the container you are moving it into, and `after` is the name of the block or container it will go after. This could instead be `before` if you want to place it before a specific block/container.

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <page layout="1column" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:View/Layout/etc/page_configuration.xsd">
        <body>
            <move element="product.info.creditkey.marketing" 
                    destination="product.info.form.content" 
                    after="product.info.addtocart"/>
        </body>
    </page>

To see the available containers you can use reference Magento's primary `catalog_product_view.xml` file, located at `vendor/magento/module-catalog/view/frontend/layout/catalog_product_view.xml`.
